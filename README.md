# Learning about Flows and Assignments in Graphs with Python
In writing an article about these two topics I used many code examples, this repository stores my full source code for that article.

## Notes
* There is code in the repo that does not appear in the article, specifically code to generate images. 
* Some names have changed between the article and this code, generally this is to do with library aliases.
